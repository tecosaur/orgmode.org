** Description

Org mode can perform complex tasks, but it is built of a simple syntax. All you
need to get started is demonstrated in the image.

  :PROPERTIES:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class main-image
[[file:img/features/folding.gif]]

** Description

Org allows you to fold sections into an outline for graceful navigation, then
seamlessly expand individual sections to read and edit using the =tab= key.

You can easily navigate through headlines and (un)fold (sub)sections of
your Org documents.

#+ATTR_HTML: :class main-image
[[file:resources/img/features/babel.gif]]

** Description

Notebooks such as [[https://jupyter.org/][Jupyter]] and [[https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/][R Markdown]] possess a subset of Org's functionality
in their ability to write syntax-highlighted code and execute it within the
document.

Org likewise has code blocks that can be executed within the document, and
supports around [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages.html][80 languages]]. Furthermore, in the same document you can use
multiple languages, even pass simple data structures between them, and write
code to generate code.

Org's capabilities make it ideally suited for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]], making the
technique a handy and natural way to deal with code.

Source code can be trivially extracted from an org file, and rich documentation
produced from the very same file.

* Tables
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: tables
  :HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: side-fig
  :END:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class main-image
[[file:resources/img/features/tables.gif]]

** Description

Org is a great plain-text table editor.

Use =tab= to move between cells, and =enter= for rows. The layout automatically is
reformatted as cell contents change.

You can import tables from =.csv= and =.tsv= files, or directly from the
current buffer; you can then export them in all the formats supported by
Org (see below).

Org can also be used as a /spreadsheet/ system.

You can add formulas using the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/calc.html][Calc Emacs package]] or Emacs lisp code.

* Publishing
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: publishing
  :HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: side-fig
  :END:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class main-image
[[file:resources/img/features/exports.gif]]

** Description

Org provides great capability as an authoring and publishing tool.

Use the intuitive Org markup syntax to create source documents that can exported
into many different formats including:
- =HTML=
- $\LaTeX{}$
- =ODT=
- and much more!

Developers can easily create new backends for their favourite format
(see the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-export-reference.html][reference documentation]]).

You can also define /publishing projects/ with one or more =.org= file(s),
and one or more publication backends.

* Extensibility
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: extensibiliy
  :HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: side-fig
  :END:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class main-image
[[file:resources/img/features/links.png]]

** Description
Org-mode isn't just capable out of the box, it's
spectacularly extensible.

Take links as an example. Updating docs for a
project and find yourself linking to GitHub issues
a lot? You can add a new link type for the
document (or globally) where in
~[[issue:74][version mismatch]]~ the link expands to
=https://github.com/author/repo/issues/74=.

This is just the beginning, you can define
arbitrary functions to resole links, link to files
on remote machines with [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode][Tramp]], and more.

In Org-mode, extensibility isn't an afterthought --- it's baked right into the
foundations.

* With your mobile phone

#+ATTR_HTML: :style float:right;box-shadow:none; :width 400px
[[file:img/external/beorg.png]]

** Description

On iOS you have the wonderful [[https://beorgapp.com/][beorg]], which supports many of Org's features, and
can sync over a variety of services.

On Android there is [[http://www.orgzly.com/][orgzly]], which is developed over on [[https://github.com/orgzly/orgzly-android][GitHub]].

* Task Management
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: planning
  :HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: side-fig
  :END:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class main-image
[[file:resources/img/features/planning.gif]]

** Description

Org is an extremely capable task manager. "Org" is short for "organisation"
after all.

Turn sections into /tasks/ by adding keywords such as =TODO= representing the state of that task.
Switch states easily with the keyboard shortcut =S-<left/right>=.

See your tasks in a planner (called an /Agenda/ in Org) by adding timestamps to them.

All done with just plain text markup.

Switching from one TODO keyword to another is =C-c C-t= or
=S-<left/right>=.
Want a different set of keywords to track your task?
No problem --- Org lets you customize them to support your workflow.

Each item can also receive planning meta-data: scheduled and/or deadline
cookies, tags, properties, etc.

* Time Tracking (Clocking)
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: clocking
  :HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: side-fig
  :END:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class main-image
[[file:resources/img/features/clocking.png]]

** Description

Keep track of the time you spend on your tasks with Org /Clocking/.

Org provides easy keyboard shortcuts to /clock in/ and /clock out/ of tasks.

At end of the day, easily generate reports of how you spent your time.

Clocking in a task is =C-c C-x C-i=.
Clocking out a task is =C-c C-x C-o=.
You can use =I= and =O= from an agenda buffer.

Clocking logs are stored in a drawer.

Org makes it easy to clock in and out and to produce nice reports, which
you can customize as needed.

* Agendas
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: agendas
  :HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: side-fig
  :END:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class main-image
[[file:resources/img/features/agenda.png]]

** Description

Plan your day, your way, with ease.

With /agenda views/ ---reports generated from a set of tasks--- you can see your
tasks on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis in a /highly/ configurable manner.

Even with large =.org= files and thousands of tasks, it is easy to focus on
what you need to do for each context.

The built-in agenda views display the scheduled and deadline task for the
week, TODO lists and stuck projects.

This is one of the key aspect of Org: you can adapt Org to your workflow
while stabilizing it.

* Capturing

  :END:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class main-image :style "filter: invert(96%) hue-rotate(270deg);"
[[file:resources/img/features/capturing.gif]]

** Description

Adding TODO items to your =.org= files is called /capturing/.

You can capture from everywhere, both within Emacs and from other
applications like your web browser, PDF viewer, etc.

Capture templates provide a quick and effective way to save information to look
at later.
