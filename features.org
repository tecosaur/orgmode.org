Org is built on top of =outline.el=.

You can easily navigate through headlines and (un)fold (sub)sections of
your Org documents.

Org enhances =outline.el= with faster keybindings and more editing
facilities.

  :END:

#+ATTR_HTML: id="main-image"
[[file:img/planning.jpg]]

Org can be used as a TODO lists manager and as a planner.

Each headline can be turned into a task.

Switching from one TODO keyword to another is =C-c C-t= or
=S-<left/right>=.

Each item can also receive planning meta-data: scheduled and/or deadline
cookies, tags, properties, etc.

* Clocking
  :PROPERTIES:

#+ATTR_HTML: id="main-image"
[[file:img/clocking.jpg]]

Clocking in a task is =C-c C-x C-i=.

Clocking out a task is =C-c C-x C-o=.

You can use =I= and =O= from an agenda buffer.

Clocking logs are stored in a drawer.

Org makes it easy to clock in and out and to produce nice reports, which
you can customize to suit the needs of your hairy boss.

Even with large =.org= files and thousands of tasks, it is easy to focus on
what you need to do for each context.

The built-in agenda views display the scheduled and deadline task for the
week, TODO lists and stuck projects.

The notion of /agenda view/ can be customized to display what you need: a
view for the day/month, restricted to a set of TODO keywords, using
specific tag, etc.

This is one of the key aspect of Org: you can adapt Org to your workflow
while stabilizing it.

* Capturing
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID: capturing
  :END:

#+ATTR_HTML: id="main-image"
[[file:img/capture.jpg]]

Adding TODO items to your =.org= files is called /capturing/.

You can capture from everywhere, both within Emacs and from other
applications like your web browser, pdf viewer, etc.

Capture templates allow you to tell what information you want to capture
from various contexts (the file name, the current date, the region, etc.)

* Tables
  :PROPERTIES:

#+ATTR_HTML: id="main-image"
[[file:img/table2.jpg]]

Org is a great plain-text table editor.

You can import tables from =.csv= and =.tsv= files, or directly from the
current buffer; you can then export them in all the formats supported by
Org (see below).

Org can also be used as a /spreadsheet/ system.  

You can add formulas using the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/calc.html][Calc Emacs package]] or Emacs lisp code.

Org is an authoring and publication tool.

You can use intuitive markup then have it converted to =HTML=, $\LaTeX{}$,
=ODT= -- and much more.

Developers can easily create new backends for their favorite format (see
the [[http://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-export-reference.html][reference documentation]]).

You can also define /publishing projects/ with one or more =.org= file(s),
and one or more publication backends.

Org makes [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]] a handy and natural way to deal with code.

You can insert code snippets, have them fontified in the Org buffer,
compute the results in-file and tangle your Org file to get a code source
file.

/Richard Moreland/ has developed [[http://mobileorg.ncogni.to/][MobileOrg]], a free software for iPhone and
iPod Touch for storing, searching, viewing and editing your Org files.

/Matt Jones/ has developed an equivalent [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3Dcom.matburt.mobileorg#?t%3DW251bGwsMSwxLDIxMiwiY29tLm1hdGJ1cnQubW9iaWxlb3JnIl0.][MobileOrg]] for the Android platform
