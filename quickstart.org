* Getting started with Org-mode
In its simplest form, Org is like any other markup language.
You can write [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html][Org syntax]] in any text editor.

However, to experience the full potential of Org you need an editor
that transforms Org syntax into a living, interactive document.

#+begin_center
#+attr_html: :class btn
*[[file:install.org][Install Org]]*
#+end_center

* Preamble
At the start of a file (before the first headline), it is common to
set the title, author, and other
[[https://orgmode.org/manual/Export-Settings.html][export options]].
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+title: The glories of Org
,#+author: A. Org Writer
#+END_SRC

* Headlines
Lines that start with and asterisk ~*~ are [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html#Headlines_and_Sections][headlines]].

A single ~*~ denotes a 1st-level headline, ~**~ denotes a 2nd-level headline, etc.
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* Welcome to Org-mode
,** Sub-heading
Each extra ~*~ increases the depth by one level.
#+END_SRC

In their simplest form headlines are just the start of a section.
However, any headline can also become a [[https://orgmode.org/manual/TODO-Items.html][TODO item]].

TODO items are the basic building block that Org uses to track and
organize all kinds of tasks.

To add a TODO item to a heading, start the heading with a TODO
keyword such as ~TODO~ or ~HOLD~.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* TODO Promulgate Org to the world
,** TODO Create a quickstart guide
#+END_SRC

* Markup
To mark up text in Org, simply surround it with one or more marker characters.
*bold* /italic/ and _underline_ are fairly intuitive, and the ability to use
+strikethrough+ is a plus.  You can _/*combine*/_ the basic markup in any
order, however ~code~ and =verbatim= need to be the *_~inner-most~_* markers
if they are present since their contents are interpreted =_literally_=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

if they are present since their contents are interpreted =_literally_=.
#+END_EXAMPLE

See [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html#Emphasis_Markers][Emphasis Markers]] for more details.

* Lists
Unordered lists start with ~+~, ~-~, or ~*~[fn::~*~ cannot
be used to start a plain list if it is immediately preceded by
a newline because it will be interpreted as a headline.].
Ordered lists start with ~1.~, ~1)~, ~A.~, or ~A)~.
Ordered and unordered bullets can be nested in any order.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
To buy:
1. Milk
2. Eggs
   - Organic
3. Cheese
   + Parmesan
   + Mozzarella
#+END_SRC

Lists can contain checkboxes ~[ ]~, ~[-]~, ~[X]~.
#+BEGIN_SRC org
- [ ] not started
- [-] in progress
- [X] complete
#+END_SRC

Lists can contain tags (and checkboxes at the same time).
#+BEGIN_SRC org
- [ ] fruits :: get apples
- [X] veggies :: get carrots
#+END_SRC

* Links
To create a link put the target between two square brackets, like so: ~[[target]]~.
You can include a description in square brackets after the target ~[[target][desc]]~.

The order is easy to remember because it is the same as an html =<a>=
tag ~<a href="target">desc</a>~ and you can't mix up brackets and
parentheses because there are only square brackets!

Org supports a wide variety of types of link targets, and you can also
[[https://orgmode.org/manual/Adding-Hyperlink-Types.html][add your own]].
Link types are indicated with a ~type:~ prefix, i.e., ~[type:target]~.
If no ~type:~ is provided, org searches the current file for a headline
that matches ~target~.

Some examples:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[[https://orgmode.org][a nice website]]
[[file:~/Pictures/dank-meme.png]]
[[earlier heading][an earlier heading in the document]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

** More info
For more on links, see the manual sections for
[[https://orgmode.org/manual/Internal-Links.html][Internal Links]] and
[[https://orgmode.org/manual/External-Links.html][External Links]].
* Images
Org mode automatically recognizes and renders image links.
Just link to an image (don't include a description). That's it. \\

#+attr_html: :height 120px
[[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Konigsberg_bridges.png]]

* Blocks
Org mode uses =#+BEGIN= ... =#+END= blocks for many purposes.
Some of the basic blocks types quote, example, and src.

If you all you need is monospace text, you can use an example block.
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
monospace
,#+END_EXAMPLE
#+END_SRC

However, example blocks do not give you the power of [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][Org babel]].
For that you need a source block.
Source blocks provide syntax highlighting, code execution, literate programming, and more.
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(message "Hello world")
,#+END_SRC
#+END_SRC

** More info
A hello world example cannot even begin to scratch the surface
Org mode's support for [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Working-with-Source-Code.html][working with source code]].

* Tables
Org mode comes with a table editor complete with support cell references
and formulas.

In its simplest form a table is text separated using pipes ~|~.
#+BEGIN_SRC org
| I    | am  | a    | table |
| with | two | rows | !     |
#+END_SRC

A more useful example is this comparison of existing Literate
programming / reproducible research tools (from
[[doi:10.18637/jss.v046.i03][Schulte /et al./ 2012]]).
#+BEGIN_SRC org
| Tool         | Literate programming? | Reproducible Research? | Languages |
|--------------+-----------------------+------------------------+-----------|
| Javadoc      | partial               | no                     | Java      |
| Haskell .lhs | partial               | no                     | Haskell   |
| noweb        | yes                   | no                     | any       |
| Sweave       | partial               | yes                    | R         |
| Org-mode     | yes                   | yes                    | any       |
#+END_SRC

Worried about aligning free text tables?
Org mode does it in a single keystroke -- =tab=.

* Comments
Org mode has a variety of ways to add comments.

Line comments start with ~#~. \\
Inline comments wrap ~@@comment:like so@@~. \\
Block comments are wrapped with ~#+BEGIN_COMMENT~ and ~#+END_COMMENT~. \\
Section comments can be created by adding the ~COMMENT~
keyword to a headline ~* COMMENT like so~[fn::There are a number of
more granular ways to control the exact behavior of headlines,
including use of the special tags ~:ARCHIVE:~ and ~:noexport:~.].

#+BEGIN_SRC org
# A line comment

Example of an @@comment:inline@@ comment.

Inline comments are used for end of line comments. @@comment:~#~ won't work@@
Since # only only works if preceeded by a newline follow by whitespace.

,#+BEGIN_COMMENT
This is a block comment.
It can span multiple line.
As well as other markup.
,#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(+ 1 2)
,#+END_SRC
,#+END_COMMENT

,* A top level headline
,** COMMENT This section and subsections are commented out
,*** This headline inherits the =COMMENT= keyword
This text is commented out
,** This headline is not commented
This text will be exported and code blocks will run.
#+END_SRC

* Macros
Org has many more advanced features built into its syntax.
To give only a single example, let's take a look at
[[https://orgmode.org/manual/Macro-Replacement.html][macros]].

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+MACRO: attn _*/$1/*_
{{{attn(ATTENTION! This text gets all the markup!)}}}

,#+HTML_HEAD: <style>.red{color:red;}</style>
,#+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage{xcolor}
,#+MACRO: red @@html:<span class="red">$1</span>@@@@latex:\textcolor{red}{$1}@@
Regular text. {{{red(This text will be red.)}}} More regular text.
#+END_SRC
