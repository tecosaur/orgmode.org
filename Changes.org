** Incompatible changes
*** Change bracket link escaping syntax

Org used to percent-encode sensitive characters in the URI part of the
bracket links.

Now, escaping mechanism uses the usual backslash character, according
to the following rules, applied in order:

1. All consecutive =\= characters at the end of the link must be
   escaped;
2. Any =]= character at the very end of the link must be escaped;
3. All consecutive =\= characters preceding =][= or =]]= patterns must
   be escaped;
4. Any =]= character followed by either =[= or =]= must be escaped;
5. Others =]= and =\= characters need not be escaped.

When in doubt, use the function ~org-link-escape~ in order to turn
a link string into its properly escaped form.

The following function will help switching your links to the new
syntax:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-update-link-syntax (&optional no-query)
  "Update syntax for links in current buffer.
Query before replacing a link, unless optional argument NO-QUERY
is non-nil."
  (interactive "P")
  (org-with-point-at 1
    (let ((case-fold-search t))
      (while (re-search-forward "\\[\\[[^]]*?%\\(?:2[05]\\|5[BD]\\)" nil t)
        (let ((object (save-match-data (org-element-context))))
          (when (and (eq 'link (org-element-type object))
                     (= (match-beginning 0)
                        (org-element-property :begin object)))
            (goto-char (org-element-property :end object))
            (let* ((uri-start (+ 2 (match-beginning 0)))
                   (uri-end (save-excursion
                              (goto-char uri-start)
                              (re-search-forward "\\][][]" nil t)
                              (match-beginning 0)))
                   (uri (buffer-substring-no-properties uri-start uri-end)))
              (when (or no-query
                        (y-or-n-p
                         (format "Possibly obsolete URI syntax: %S.  Fix? "
                                 uri)))
                (setf (buffer-substring uri-start uri-end)
                      (org-link-escape (org-link-decode uri)))))))))))
#+end_src

The old ~org-link-escape~ and ~org-link-unescape~ functions have been
renamed into ~org-link-encode~ and ~org-link-decode~.

*** Change match group number in ~org-link-bracket-re~

Link description, if any, is located in match group 2 instead of match
group 3.

*** ob-clojure does not auto prepend ~(ns ..)~ statement anymore

When tangling, user usually just wants to tangle literally code instead
of prepend inserting a ~(ns ..)~ statement before source block
code.  Now, when you have no ~:ns~ header argument specified, this
behavior will not happen automatically.

*** Change in behavior on exit from an Org edit buffer

Org will no longer attempt to restore the window configuration in the
frame to which the user returns after editing a source block with
~org-edit-src-code~.  Instead, the window configuration will remain as
it is.

*** Change default value for ~org-email-link-description-format~

When linking from a mail buffer, Org used to truncate the subject of
the message to 30 characters in order to build the description of the
link.  This behavior was considered as too surprising.  As
a consequence, Org no longer truncates subjects.

You can get the old behaviour back with the following:

: (setq org-email-link-description-format "Email %c: %.30s")

*** ~:file~ header argument no longer assume "file" ~:results~

The "file" ~:results~ value is now mandatory for a code block
returning a link to a file.  The ~:file~ or ~:file-ext~ header
arguments no longer imply a "file" result is expected.

*** Plain numbers are hours in Column View mode

See [[git:3367ac9457]] for details.

*** All LaTeX preview backends use now xcolor

The dvipng backend was previously relying on fg and bg parameters to
be passed to the CLI. This didn't work when xcolor was directly or
indirectly used in the document (e.g. tkiz is a user of xcolor). Since
every other backend was already using xcolor to set fg and bg, the CLI
alternative was removed and there is no more a :use-xcolor options
since now it's implicitly always true.

*** Org-Attach Git commit

[[*Org-Attach has been refactored and extended][Refactoring of Org-Attach]] affected the Git commit functionality.  Not
much, but the following changes are required if you still need to
auto-commit attachments to git:

- Customization of ~org-attach-annex-auto-get~ needs to be renamed to
  ~org-attach-git-annex-auto-get~.

- Customization of ~org-attach-commit~ is no longer needed.  Instead
  one need to require the =org-attach-git= module in the startup.

** New features
*** New option to wrap source code lines in HTML export

When new option ~html-wrap-src-lines~ (with variable
~org-html-wrap-src-lines~) is non-nil, HTML export wraps source code
lines in HTML ~code~ elements.

*** New option to handle schedules and deadlines in iCalendar export

Export ignore done tasks with a deadline when
~org-icalendar-use-deadline~ contains ~event-if-todo-not-done~.
Likewise, scheduled done tasks are also ignored when
~org-icalendar-use-scheduled~ contains the same symbol.

*** Add split-window-right option for src block edit window placement

Given the increasing popularity of wide screen monitors, splitting
horizontally may make more sense than splitting vertically.  An
option, ~split-window-right~, to request horizontal splitting has been
added to ~org-src-window-setup~.

*** Org-Attach has been refactored and extended

Org attach has been refactored and the functionality extended.  It
should now be easier to understand how it works.  A few improvements
and extra options have been added as well.

From the initial comment in org-attach source-code:

- Attachments are managed either by using a custom property DIR or by
  using property ID from org-id.  When DIR is defined, a location in
  the filesystem is directly attached to the outline node.  When
  org-id is used, attachments are stored in a folder named after the
  ID, in a location defined by ~org-attach-id-dir~.  DIR has
  precedence over ID when both parameters are defined for the current
  outline node (also when inherited parameters are taken into
  account).

From now on inheritance requires no extra property and will adhere to
~org-attach-use-inheritance~ by default.  Inheritance can be
customized to always be activated or never be activated in
~org-attach-use-inheritance~.

The ATTACH_DIR property is deprecated in favour of the shorter
property DIR.  Links to folders inside the DIR property can now be
declared as relative links.  This is not enabled by default, but can
be set in ~org-attach-dir-relative~.

When adding new attachment to the outline node the preferred way of
doing so can be customized.  Take a look at
~org-attach-preferred-new-method~.  It defaults to using ID since that
was the behaviour before this change.

If both DIR and ID properties are set on the same node, DIR has
precedence and will be used.

One can now also choose to build attachment-directory-paths in a
customized way.  This is an advanced topic, but in some case it makes
sense to parse an ID in a different way than the default one.  Create
your own function and add it to the beginning of
~org-attach-id-to-path-function~list~ if you want to customize the ID
based folder structure.

If you've used ATTACH_DIR properties to manage attachments, use the
following code to rename that property to DIR which supports the same
functionality.  ATTACH_DIR_INHERIT is no longer supported and is
removed.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun org-update-attach-properties ()
      "Change properties for Org-Attach."
      (interactive)
      (org-with-point-at 1
	(while (outline-next-heading)
	  (let ((DIR (org--property-local-values "ATTACH_DIR" nil)))
	    (when DIR
	      (org-set-property "DIR" (car DIR))
	      (org-delete-property "ATTACH_DIR"))))
	(org-delete-property-globally "ATTACH_DIR_INHERIT")))
#+end_src

For those who hate breaking changes, even though the changes are made
to clean things up; fear not.  ATTACH_DIR will still continue to work.
It's just not documented any longer.  When you get the chance, run the
code above to clean things up anyways!

**** New hooks
Two hooks are added to org-attach:
- org-attach-after-change-hook
- org-attach-open-hook

They are added mostly for internal restructuring purposes, but can
ofc. be used for other things as well.

*** New link-type: Attachment

Attachment-links are now first-class citizens.  They mimic file-links
in everything they do but use the existing attachment-folder as a base
when expanding the links. Both =DIR= and =ID= properties are used to
try to resolve the links, in exactly the same way as Org-Attach uses
those properties.

*** Handle overlay specification for notes in Beamer export

This aligns Beamer notes with slide overlays.

*** Add support for lettered lists in Texinfo

Using =:enum A= or =:enum a= Texinfo attribute switches an otherwise
numbered list to a lettered list.

*** Add a dispatcher command to insert dynamic blocks

You can add new dynamic blocks with function
~org-dynamic-block-define~.  All such dynamic blocks can be used by
~org-dynamic-block-insert-dblock~ command.

*** Babel

**** ob-emacs-lisp sets ~lexical-binding~ in Org edit buffers

When editing an Elisp src block, the editing buffer's
~lexical-binding~ is set according to the src block's =:lexical=
parameter.

**** Add LaTeX output support in PlantUML

*** New minor mode to display headline numbering

Use =<M-x org-num-mode>= to get a visual indication of the numbering
in the outline.  The numbering is also automatically updated upon
changes in the buffer.

*** New property =HTML_HEADLINE_CLASS= in HTML export

The new property =HTML_HEADLINE_CLASS= assigns a class attribute to
a headline.

*** Allow LaTeX attributes and captions for "table.el" tables

Supported LaTeX attributes are ~:float~, ~:center~, ~:font~ and
~:caption~.

*** Attach buffer contents to headline

With =<b>= key from attachment dispatcher (=<C-c C-a>=), it is now
possible to write the contents of a buffer to a file in the headline
attachment directory.

*** iCalendar export respects a =CLASS= property

Set the =CLASS= property on an entry to specify a visibility class for
that entry only during iCalendar export. The property can be set to
anything the calendar server supports. The iCalendar standard defines
the values =PUBLIC=, =CONFIDENTIAL=, =PRIVATE=, which can be
interpreted as publicly visible, accessible to a specific group, and
private respectively.

This property can be inherited during iCalendar export, depending on
the value of ~org-use-property-inheritance~.

*** New parameter for =INCLUDE= keyword

Add =:coding CODING-SYSTEM= to include files using a different coding
system than the main Org document.  For example:

#+begin_example
,#+INCLUDE: "myfile.cmd" src cmd :coding cp850-dos
#+end_example

*** New values in clock tables' step: =month= and =year=
*** ODT export handles numbers cookies in lists
*** New cell movement functions in tables

~S-<UP>~, ~S-<DOWN>~, ~S-<RIGHT>~, and ~S-<LEFT>~ now move cells in
the corresponding direction by swapping with the adjacent cell.

*** New option to natively fontify LaTeX snippets and environments

A 'native option was added to org-highlight-latex-and-related. It
matches the same structures than 'latex but it calls
org-src-font-lock-fontify-block instead, thus bringing about full
LaTeX font locking.

*** ~org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift~ learnt to shift backward in time

=<C-c C-x c>= (~org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift~) now takes a
negative value as a valid repeater to shift time stamps in backward
in cloned subtrees.  You can give, for example, ‘-3d’ to shift three
days in the past.

*** Toggle display of all vs. undone scheduled habits conveniently

=<C-u K>= (~org-habit-toggle-display-in-agenda~) in an agenda toggles
the display of all habits to those which are undone and scheduled.
This is a function for convenience.

*** New parameter for SQL Babel blocks: ~:dbconnection~

The new parameter ~:dbconnection~ allows to specify a connection name
in a SQL block header: this name is used to look up connection
parameters in ~sql-connection-alist~.

*** New =:scale= attribute supported by LaTeX exporters

The builtin "latex" exporters now accept and use a =:scale= attribute,
which scales an image by a given factor.

This attribute is wrapped adound the =scale= parameter of LaTeX's
=\includegraphics= (bitmap images) or a TiKZ's =\scalebox=.
Therefore, its value should be some string palatable to LaTeX as
a positive float Its default value is an empty string (i.e. disabled).

This attribute overrides the =:width= and =:height= attributes.

#+begin_example
,#+name: Beastie
,#+caption: I think I saw this curious horse already, but where ?
,#+LATEX_ATTR: :scale 2
[[https://orgmode.org/img/org-mode-unicorn-logo.png]]
#+end_example

*** Allow specifying the target for a table of contents

The =+TOC= keyword now accepts a =:target:= attribute that specifies
the headline to use for making the table of contents.

#+begin_example
,* Target
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: TargetSection
  :END:
,** Heading A
,** Heading B
,* Another section
,#+TOC: headlines 1 :target "#TargetSection"
#+end_example

** New functions
*** ~org-dynamic-block-insert-dblock~

Use default keybinding =<C-c C-x x>= to run command
~org-dynamic-block-insert-dblock~.  It will prompt user to select
dynamic block in ~org-dynamic-block-alist~.

*** ~org-table-cell-up~
*** ~org-table-cell-down~
*** ~org-table-cell-left~
*** ~org-table-cell-right~
*** ~org-habit-toggle-display-in-agenda~
** Removed functions and variables
*** Removed Org Drill

You can install it back from MELPA.

*** ~org-babel-set-current-result-hash~
*** ~org-capture-insert-template-here~
*** ~org-attach-directory~

It has been deprecated in favour of ~org-attach-id-dir~ which is less
ambiguous given the restructured org-attach.

*** ~org-enable-fixed-width-editor~

This variable was not used through the code base.

** Miscellaneous
*** Change signature for ~org-list-to-subtree~

The function now accepts the level of the subtree as an optional
argument.  It no longer deduces it from the current level.

*** LaTeX preview is simplified

Function ~org-latex-preview~, formerly known as
~org-toggle-latex-fragment~, has a hopefully simpler and more
predictable behavior.  See its docstring for details.

*** ~org-table-copy-down~ supports patterns

When ~org-table-copy-increment~ is non-nil, it is now possible to
increment fields like =A1=, or =0A=, i.e., any string prefixed or
suffixed with a whole number.

*** No more special indentation for description items

Descriptions items are indented like regular ones, i.e., text starts
after the bullet.  Special indentation used to introduce bugs when
inserting sub-items in a description list.

*** New hook: ~org-todo-repeat-hook~

This hook was actually introduced in Org 9.2.1, but wasn't advertised.

*** Org Table reads numbers starting with 0 as strings
*** Disable fast tag selection interface via prefix arg

A call of ~org-set-tags-command~ with prefix argument C-u C-u avoids
the fast tag selection interface and instead offers the plain
interface.

*** ~:mkdirp~ now supports create directory for ~:dir~ path

The ~:mkdirp~ header argument used to only work for ~:tangle~ tangle
files. Now ~:mkdirp~ works for ~:dir~ too. This is more convenient for
specify default directory and with ~:file~ header argument.

*** New variable: ~org-agenda-breadcrumbs-separator~

If breadcrumbs are showed in org-agenda with the help of "%b" format
in ~org-agenda-prefix-format~, user can customize breadcrumbs's
separator using ~org-agenda-breadcrumbs-separator~.

*** New variable ~org-attach-commands~

This variable makes it possible to customize the list of commands for
the attachment dispatcher.

*** New ID method based on timestamp

If one chooses, it is now possible to create ID's based on timestamp
(ISO8601) instead of UUID by changing org-id-method to ts.

For an improved folder structure when using timestamp as ID, make sure
to promote ~org-attach-id-ts-folder-format~ to the first element of
~org-attach-id-to-path-function-list~ in your configuration at the
same time.

*** New customization: ~org-id-locations-relative~

New customization to make the persisting of org-id-locations between
sessions to store links to files as relative instead of absolute.  The
links will be stored as relative to the path of org-id-locations-file.

*** ~org-ctrl-c-tab~ is functional before the first headline

I.e. treat the whole file as if it was a subtree.

Also fold everything below the chosen level.  Former behavior was to
leave unfolded subtrees unfolded.

*** ~org-kill-note-or-show-branches~ is functional before the first headline

I.e. treat the whole file as if it was a subtree.

*** Respect narrowing when agenda command is restricted to buffer
